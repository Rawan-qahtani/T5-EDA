# Analysis of the train stations and Entries
### The goal of this project is to identify the three busiest train stations for a period of 
### three months to place food trucks near them to better increase revenue.

### To start exploring this goal, I used a bar chart model with one feature to describe Total entries or Density each station.
### The figure depicts the model (blue) "Entry number per station"
### This result suggests that number entries of station may have a significant positive impact on a food trucks revenue. 
### However, the magnitude  that entries is  important factor in determining the success of a food trucks.
